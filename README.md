 Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This repository is about building an Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Python to predict Plant Diseases from leaf images.

It is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that includes:

âœ… Model training on Kaggle PlantVillage Dataset
